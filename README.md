# Generative Adversarial Network - Fake Houses
GAN implementation for Realtor.com Images


We want to create fake images for properties in Realtor.com that do not have any images. 
- image of the house outside - residential(single, semi-attached, condo, highrise)?
- interior (room, ...)
- garden...
We need over 10_000 images.



Piece of project:
- GAN Training model
- GAN Transfer Learning - function(property_type=house, city, <500K)
- 
We need 500 images?
