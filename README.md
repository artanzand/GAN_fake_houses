# Generative Adversarial Network
GAN implementation for Realtor.com Images

What GAN is and what it does. 
The scope of the project
We want to create fake images for properties in a Real Estate company that do not have any images. 
- image of the house outside - residential(single, semi-attached, condo, highrise)?
- interior (room, ...)
- garden...
We need over 10_000 images.

- training image
- animation

# Usage
## Webscraping
```
python function.py --ar=<>
```
path, num_images, search_title

## Training the model
The function to train. This doesn't take any arguments.

## Image Creation
The function with predicted images
```
```
num_images




# Data
## Original Data source
house pricesand images socal - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ted8080/house-prices-and-images-socal)

## Webscraping
To do the webscraping run this script
```
```

## Data clearning and Resize
the two functions for removing margins and resizing

## Results
probability and loss results images

## Lessons Learned
- data size
- Outdoor images
- Weight decay
- hyperparameters
